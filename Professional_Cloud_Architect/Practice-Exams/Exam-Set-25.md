b. Vehicles write data directly to **Google Cloud Pub/Sub**  
c. Vehicles stream data directly to **Google BigQuery**  
d. Vehicles continue to write data using the existing system (**FTP**)  

---

## ✅ Correct Answer

**b. Vehicles write data directly to Google Cloud Pub/Sub**

---

## Explanation

The ingestion system must handle:

- **Extremely high throughput** (millions of events per second)  
- **Global scale** and bursty traffic  
- **Reliable, durable ingestion**  
- **Decoupling** producers (vehicles) from downstream consumers  

### Why **Cloud Pub/Sub** is the right choice 🚀

Cloud Pub/Sub is designed for **massive, real-time event ingestion** and provides:

- Automatic **horizontal scaling**
- Support for **millions of messages per second**
- **Durable message storage** with at-least-once delivery
- Ability to **fan out** data to multiple consumers (e.g., Dataflow, BigQuery, storage)
- Loose coupling between vehicles and backend processing systems

This makes Pub/Sub the **standard Google-recommended ingestion layer** for IoT-scale workloads.

---

## ❌ Why the other options are wrong

**a. Writing directly to GCS**

B. Create a BigQuery table for the European data, and set the table retention period to 36 months. For Cloud Storage, use gsutil to create a SetStorageClass to NONE action when with an Age condition of 36 months.  
C. Create a BigQuery time-partitioned table for the European data, and set the partition expiration period to 36 months. For Cloud Storage, use gsutil to enable lifecycle management using a DELETE action with an Age condition of 36 months.  
D. Create a BigQuery time-partitioned table for the European data, and set the partition expiration period to 36 months. For Cloud Storage, use gsutil to create a SetStorageClass to NONE action with an Age condition of 36 months.  

---

## ✅ Correct Answer

**C. Create a BigQuery time-partitioned table for the European data, and set the partition expiration period to 36 months. For Cloud Storage, use gsutil to enable lifecycle management using a DELETE action with an Age condition of 36 months.**

---

## Explanation

- **BigQuery**:  
  Using a **time-partitioned table** with a **partition expiration** of 36 months ensures that data is **automatically deleted** at the partition level, which is the recommended and scalable approach for managing time-based data retention.

- **Cloud Storage**:  
  **Lifecycle management with a DELETE action** and an **Age condition of 36 months** automatically removes objects that exceed the GDPR retention requirement.

This solution is **fully automated**, **scalable**, and **GDPR-compliant** across both storage services.

---

## ❌ Why the other options are wrong

**A. Non-partitioned BigQuery table**  
- Table-level expiration is less flexible and not ideal for large, time-series datasets.

**B. SetStorageClass to NONE**  
- Does **not delete data**, which violates GDPR requirements.

**D. SetStorageClass instead of DELETE**  
- Changing storage class does not remove personal data and is **not GDPR compliant**.

---

## ✅ Correct Answer

**A**

---

## Explanation

TerramEarth needs to:

- **Retain data for exactly 1 year**
- **Minimize storage costs**
- **Automatically manage storage transitions and deletion**

Option **A** meets these requirements:

- Data starts in **Standard** storage for active access
- After **30 days**, it moves to **Coldline**, which is much cheaper for infrequently accessed data
- After **365 days**, the data is **deleted**, ensuring compliance with the 1-year retention requirement

# 16. Securing Cloud Function-to-Cloud Function Invocation

## Question

For this question, refer to the TerramEarth case study. You start to build a new application that uses a few Cloud Functions for the backend. One use case requires a Cloud Function func_display to invoke another Cloud Function func_query. You want func_query only to accept invocations from func_display. You also want to follow Google's recommended best practices. What should you do?

A. Create a token and pass it in as an environment variable to func_display. When invoking func_query, include the token in the request. Pass the same token to func_query and reject the invocation if the tokens are different.  
B. Make func_query 'Require authentication.' Create a unique service account and associate it to func_display. Grant the service account invoker role for func_query. Create an id token in func_display and include the token to the request when invoking func_query.  
C. Make func_query 'Require authentication' and only accept internal traffic. Create those two functions in the same VPC. Create an ingress firewall rule for func_query to only allow traffic from func_display.  
D. Create those two functions in the same project and VPC. Make func_query only accept internal traffic. Create an ingress firewall for func_query to only allow traffic from func_display. Also, make sure both functions use the same service account.
