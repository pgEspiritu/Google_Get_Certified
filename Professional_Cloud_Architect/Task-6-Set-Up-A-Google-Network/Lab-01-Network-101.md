## 🌍 Understanding Regions and Zones

- **Region**: A geographic location
- **Zone**: An isolated location within a region

📍 Example:
- Region: `us-central1`
- Zones: `us-central1-a`, `us-central1-b`, `us-central1-c`, `us-central1-f`

### 📊 Common Regions & Zones

| Region | Zones |
|------|------|
| Western US | us-west1-a, us-west1-b |
| Central US | us-central1-a, b, d, f |
| Eastern US | us-east1-b, c, d |
| Western Europe | europe-west1-b, c, d |
| Eastern Asia | asia-east1-a, b, c |

📌 **Key Notes**
- VM instances and disks are **zonal resources**
- Resources must be in the **same zone or region** to attach or assign IPs

---

## 🧠 Google Cloud Network Concepts

### 🗂️ Projects
- Organize resources, IAM, billing, and quotas
- Commonly mapped to teams
- Isolated unless connected via:
  - Shared VPC
  - VPC Peering

### 🌐 Networks (VPC)
- Connect resources internally and externally
- Use **firewall rules** for access control
- Can be:
  - 🌍 **Global** (multi-region)
  - 📍 **Regional** (low-latency)

### 🧩 Subnetworks
- Regional resources
- Group related instances
- Use private RFC1918 IP ranges

#### 🔄 Network Modes
- **Auto Mode**
  - One subnet per region
  - IP ranges created automatically
- **Custom Mode**
  - No subnets by default
  - You create subnets manually
  - Full control over IP ranges

---

## 📍 Set Your Default Region and Zone

Run the following commands in **Cloud Shell**:
```bash
gcloud config set compute/zone "Zone"
export ZONE=$(gcloud config get compute/zone)

gcloud config set compute/region "Region"
export REGION=$(gcloud config get compute/region)
```

## 🧭 Task 1. Review the Default Network

When a new Google Cloud project is created, a **default VPC network** is automatically provided. This default network uses **auto subnet mode**, which means:

- 🌍 Each region automatically gets a subnetwork
- ➕ You can create up to **four additional networks** per project
- 🧩 Additional networks can be:
  - Auto subnet networks
  - Custom subnet networks
  - Legacy networks

📌 **IP Addressing**
- Every VM instance created in a subnetwork is assigned an **IPv4 address** from that subnetwork’s IP range.

---

## 🌐 Review the VPC Network

1. In the Cloud Console, click:  
   **Navigation menu (☰) > VPC network**
2. Review the list of VPC networks, including:
   - 📡 IP address ranges
   - 🚪 Gateways
   - 🌍 Network type (auto/custom)

## 🔥 Firewalls Overview

Each VPC network includes **firewall rules** to control traffic.

### 🔒 Default Firewall Behavior
- 🚫 **All inbound traffic is blocked by default**
- ✅ To allow inbound traffic, you must create **allow rules**
- 📤 Outbound traffic is **allowed by default**, unless restricted using **egress rules**

You can:
- Allow specific **ingress** traffic
- Deny or restrict **egress** traffic
- Create a **default-deny egress policy** to block all outbound connections

💡 **Best Practice**
- Always configure the **least permissive firewall rules**
- Target only the instances that need access
- Avoid overly broad rules that allow traffic to all instances

⚖️ **Firewall Rule Priority**
- Rules have priority values
- 🔢 Lower numbers = higher priority
- The first matching rule (lowest number) is applied
- Complex override rules can lead to unintended access—use carefully

---

## 🔐 Default Network Firewall Rules

Only the **default network** has pre-created firewall rules.  
Custom or auto networks you create later **do not** include any firewall rules by default.

### 🚪 Ingress Rules Automatically Created

- **default-allow-internal**  
  - Allows all protocols and ports between instances in the same network

- **default-allow-ssh**  
  - Allows SSH (TCP port 22) from any source

- **default-allow-rdp**  
  - Allows RDP (TCP port 3389) from any source

- **default-allow-icmp**  
  - Allows ICMP (ping) traffic from any source

---

## 🔍 Review Firewall Rules

1. In the Cloud Console, click:  
   **Navigation menu (☰) > VPC network > Firewall**
2. Review the firewall rules list, including:
   - 🔁 Direction (Ingress / Egress)
   - 🎯 Targets
   - 🔎 Filters
   - 🔌 Protocols / Ports
   - 🏷️ Priority
   - 🌐 Network

---

## 🛣️ Network Routes

All VPC networks automatically include:
- 🌍 A **default route to the Internet**
- 🧩 Routes to internal IP ranges within the network

📌 Route names are auto-generated and may differ per project.

---

## 🧭 Review Default Routes

1. In the Cloud Console, click:  
   **Navigation menu (☰) > VPC network > Routes**
2. Select a **Network** and **Region**
3. Review the routes, including:
   - 📄 Description
   - 🎯 Destination IP range
   - 🔢 Priority
   - 🌐 Associated network

✅ You have now reviewed the default network, firewall rules, and routing behavior in Google Cloud

---

## 🛠️ Task 2. Creating a Custom Network

When manually assigning subnetwork IP ranges, you must first create a **custom VPC network**, then add subnetworks per region.

### 📌 Key Concepts
- 🌍 You do **not** need to create subnetworks for all regions immediately
- 🚫 You **cannot create VM instances** in a region without a subnetwork
- 🏷️ Subnetwork names must be **unique per region within a project**
- 🔁 The same subnet name can be reused in another region
- 📡 Subnetworks do **not** have a network-level IPv4 range or gateway IP

⚠️ You may create the network using **either**:
- Cloud Console **or**
- Cloud Shell (`gcloud`)

👉 Choose **one method only** and follow it consistently.

---

## 🌐 Create a Custom VPC Network (Console)

1. Click:  
   **Navigation menu (☰) > VPC network**

2. Click **Create VPC Network**

![Lab 1.5](images/Lab-1.5.png)

3. Enter:
   - **Name**: `taw-custom-network`

![Lab 1.6](images/Lab-1.6.png)

---

## 🧩 Create Subnetworks (Custom Tab)

### First Subnet
- **Subnet name**: `subnet-us-east1`
- **Region**: `us-east1`
- **IP address range**: `10.0.0.0/16`
- Click **Done**

🪟 The **Create a VPC network** dialog box is now populated.

![Lab 1.7](images/Lab-1.7.png)
![Lab 1.8](images/Lab-1.8.png)

---

### Add Two More Subnets

Click **Add Subnet**, then add:

- `subnet-us-east4`, `us-east4`, `10.1.0.0/16`

![Lab 1.9](images/Lab-1.9.png)
![Lab 1.10](images/Lab-1.10.png)

- `subnet-us-central1`, `us-central1`, `10.2.0.0/16`

![Lab 1.11](images/Lab-1.11.png)
![Lab 1.12](images/Lab-1.12.png)

---

## ✅ Finish Network Creation

- Click **Create**

At this point:
- 🌍 Routes to the Internet are automatically created
- 🔁 Routes to internal instances are ready
- 🚫 **No firewall rules exist yet**, even between instances

🔐 To allow access to instances, you must **explicitly create firewall rules**.

➡️ Continue to the **Adding firewall rules** section.

---

## 🔥 Task 3. Adding Firewall Rules

To allow access to VM instances, you must configure **firewall rules**.  
For this lab, firewall rules are applied using **instance tags**, meaning the rule applies to **any VM with the same tag**.

### 🏷️ About Instance Tags
- Used by **VPC networks and firewalls** to target VM instances
- Helpful when multiple VMs serve the same role (e.g., web servers)
- Tags are also exposed in the **metadata server**, usable by applications

You will:
1. 🌐 Allow HTTP traffic from the Internet
2. ➕ Add additional rules for ICMP, internal traffic, SSH, and RDP

---

## 🌐 Add Firewall Rules Using the Console

1. In the Cloud Console, go to:  
   **Navigation menu (☰) > VPC network**

2. Click **taw-custom-network**

3. Open the **Firewalls** tab, then click **Add Firewall Rule**

---

## 🛣️ Note on Routes
- Routes direct packets **between subnetworks** and **to the Internet**
- Default routes are **automatically created** when subnetworks exist
- These default routes **cannot be modified**
- Custom routes can be added (e.g., to VPNs or gateways)
- 🔗 **Routes + Firewalls** work together to control traffic flow
